YAMP - Yet Another Microservice Project
# Introduction
## Project Overview:
- This e-commerce cloud-based microservice project is designed for learning purposes, with a strong emphasis on microservices architecture and its associated concerns. Key areas of focus include:
    - Service Discovery
    - Load Balancing
    - Fault Tolerance
    - Distributed Tracing,Distributed transaction
    - Monitoring
    - ... and more

- Given my interest in DevOps, Iâ€™ve also integrated several DevOps practices into the project, such as:
  CI/CD Pipeline
  Containerization
  Orchestration
  Monitoring
  Logging
  also
- I write about Unit test and integration test for integrated with CI/CD pipeline

While the project is still evolving and currently lacks some business logic and features, I am committed to continuously adding more functionalities in the future.
